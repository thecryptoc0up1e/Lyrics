Slow down, you crazy child

we’ve all been anxious for quite a while 

A couple wars might start while europe’s
going dark what’s the play?

What’s the fire we should worry about?
They buy our eyeballs and our clicks and then they burn us out

it’s hard to tell what’s true
And only hate seems to grow every day

But you know that when the lies get old

That we can think for ourselves instead of just getting told,

What to—eat buy, while losing privacy through and through,

When will you realize Big Brother waits for you?

Slow down, open your mind.

There ain’t no red or blue it’s state vs. you and now is the time 
to say no to CBDCs that can fund anything that they like… they like..

Sounds bad, but it's the life we lead 
They use our dollars in wars while we can’t get what we need

Part of you feels something’s wrong
And the funny thing is that you’re right, you’re right. 

The system’s broken, the money’s a lie.

How can you call it life when you’re just forced to work 'til you die. 

Save on, but don't imagine it’ll hold value.

Maybe you’ll realize

Bitcoin waits for you…
